**Actively looking for summer internship.**

I am 5th year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. My research focuses on machine learning and developing algorithms that combine complementary structured and unstructured knowledge to improve performance. My research aims to apply curriculum learning methods for selecting and organizing data to create algorithms that deliver better performance with less data and shorter training times.

My research focuses on machine learning and developing algorithms to combine structured and unstructured knowledge. 
My work focuses on efficiently combining complimentary information from text and graph data to get better performance. 
and developing curriculum Learning techniques for data selection and ordering strategies to build algoirhtm that perform better with less data and less training time.
Moreover, I have studied and published detailed analysis on training models more effectively with less data and time by applying various curriculum learning methods. These methods evaluate the complexities of the data from multiple views and designed scheduler orders the examples for effective and efficient  training. Lastly, my work also focuses on fine grained control transformation of graphs which helps in data augmentation in low resource settings and to refine ontologies. 
My research expertise and work experience includes developing AI algorithms using structure and unstructure knowledge (Graphs and Natural Language Processing ) applied  on generic and health care data.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
